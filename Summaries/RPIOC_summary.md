**Challenges**

Havenmakers can struggle with emotional depletion. Their deep empathy and focus on providing care for others can sometimes leave them feeling drained or overwhelmed.

They risk losing their own sense of self if they become too absorbed in the needs of others, neglecting their own well-being.

They don’t fear emotional connection — but they fear *losing themselves in the process*.

**Growth**

Havenmakers grow when they learn to balance their role as a protector with their own need for care and support. They understand that their own well-being must be maintained if they are to continue offering sanctuary to others. They grow when they embrace the idea that they too deserve a safe space to rest and recharge, allowing others to step in and help when needed.

At their best, Havenmakers teach us that true care is about offering both security and vulnerability. They show us that creating safe spaces requires not only protecting others but also nurturing oneself in the process.

They don’t just protect others — they *create safety for all*.
