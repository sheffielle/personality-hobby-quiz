# Igniter
## Who is the Igniter?
**Code: O-O-A-S-B**

The Igniter is the spark of transformation — bold, kinetic, and instinctively driven to *jumpstart change, momentum, and breakthrough where stagnation has taken hold*. They don’t wait for the right time — they *create it with fire and faith*.

They’re not reckless — they’re *catalysts of courageous beginnings*.

---

## The Life of the Mind

Igniters think in urgency, potential, and disruption. Their mind pulses with: *Why not now? What are we waiting for? What if the breakthrough is just one bold move away?*

They see possibility in motion — not in theory. They don’t sit with problems — they *shake them up until something new emerges*. Their thoughts are fueled by *what could be sparked with one brave decision*.

They don’t fear friction — they *use it to ignite transformation*.

---

## Personality in Practice

Igniters thrive in entrepreneurship, activism, early-stage leadership, crisis intervention, performance, and anywhere bold shifts are needed. They are the match that lights the fuse — *not to destroy, but to illuminate what’s been waiting to come alive*.

They don’t crave chaos — they *believe in forward motion*. Their presence *reminds others what it feels like to move again*.

They don’t settle — they *ignite*.

---

## Relationships & Communication

Igniters are passionate, motivating, and intensely present in relationships. They show love by *believing in your potential — and daring you to act on it*. They push, challenge, and *cheer for your risks as if they were their own*.

They speak with passion, clarity, and charge. Their words don’t always land gently — but *they land with impact*. They help others remember their spark.

They don’t sugarcoat — they *ignite truth with boldness and love*.

---

## Challenges

Igniters may struggle with restlessness, overstepping, or pushing others too hard. Their intensity can be overwhelming — or come off as insensitive to timing. They may also burn out from constant acceleration.

They’re not careless — they’re *just always one spark away from the next possibility*.

---

## Growth

Igniters grow when they realize that *sustainable fire needs air and rest*. That they don’t need to force every breakthrough — some shifts emerge slowly, too. At their best, Igniters don’t just light fires — they *ignite courage, clarity, and a future worth leaping into*.
