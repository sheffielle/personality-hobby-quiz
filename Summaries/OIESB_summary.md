## The Life of the Mind

## Challenges

Mediators may struggle with over-accommodation, feeling responsible for resolving conflicts that may not be theirs to fix. They can become frustrated when they feel unable to bring about understanding or when they encounter resistance to compromise.

They’re not passive — they’re *driven to create peace and harmony, but need to ensure they don’t lose themselves in the process*.

## Growth

Mediators grow when they learn that *true peace doesn’t always come from compromise, but from authentic understanding and respect for differing perspectives*. That while they are skilled at fostering harmony, *they must learn to stand firm in their own beliefs and not give in too easily*. At their best, Mediators don’t just resolve conflicts — they *empower others to find their own paths to reconciliation*.
