**Challenges**

Lanterns can struggle with their quiet, unassuming nature. Their desire to guide and support others without seeking attention can sometimes lead to their contributions going unnoticed. They may also become overwhelmed by the weight of always being the steady presence, especially if they feel others are not fully appreciating the light they offer.

They risk burning out by overextending themselves without asking for what they need in return.

They don’t fear darkness — but they fear *fading into the background*.
