**Challenges**

Everwells can struggle with being misunderstood. Their inner peace and self-sufficiency may make others feel like they are distant or detached.

This can lead them to become emotionally isolated, even though they are deeply capable of offering support to others.

They risk becoming disconnected from others if they don’t allow themselves to open up and share their own struggles.

Everwells grow when they learn that their self-sufficiency doesn’t mean they have to carry everything alone. They understand that it’s okay to lean on others and allow themselves to be vulnerable.

At their best, Everwells teach us that true strength comes from within, but it is amplified when shared with others. They show us that calm confidence is not about perfection; it’s about staying true to ourselves and being there for others.

They don’t stand alone — they *stand with others*.
