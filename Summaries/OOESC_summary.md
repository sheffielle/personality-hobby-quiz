## The Life of the Mind

Listeners think in terms of emotional dynamics, subtle cues, and deep understanding. Their mind often asks: *What are they really feeling? What needs to be heard, not just said? How can I show them that I understand?*

They observe, reflect, and process deeply before offering any response. Their strength lies in their ability to *hold space for others' emotions and give them room to express themselves fully*.

They don’t jump to conclusions — they *wait for the full story to unfold*.
